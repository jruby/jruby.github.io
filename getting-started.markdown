# Getting Started with JRuby
  
JRuby is one of the easiest Ruby implementations to set up. Let's start with the basic instructions:

1. **Download JRuby**:&nbsp;Visit the [download page](/download) and grab the binaries for the latest JRuby release.
2. **Unpack JRuby**:&nbsp;Unpack the file you downloaded. You'll then have a &quot;jruby-&lt;version&gt;&quot;&nbsp;directory.
3. **Run JRuby**:&nbsp;The JRuby startup script lives in the &quot;bin&quot;&nbsp;directory. Run &quot;bin/jruby -v&quot; to confirm it.

That's about it!

# Windows

If you're on Windows, we've already prepared several flavors of
[installers](/download) for you. Just pick 32- or 64-bit, and whether
to bundle the Java Virtual Machine or not.

# Other ways to get JRuby

If you use [RVM](https://rvm.io/), then installing
JRuby is also a piece of cake:

    rvm install jruby

JRuby might also be available as OS packages for your favorite package
manager, check the [JRuby Distributions](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/JRubyDistributions)
page for more information.
