---

The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.4.9.0.

* Homepage: [https://www.jruby.org/](https://www.jruby.org/)
* Download: [https://www.jruby.org/download](https://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 9.4.x targets Ruby 3.1 compatibility.

Thank you to our contributors this release, you help keep JRuby moving forward! [@kares], [@jpcamara], [@jsvd]

Ruby Compatibility
------------------

* Various fixes for keyword arguments. [#8344], [#8344], [#8382], [#8389]
* Mutex has been fixed to check for thread interrupts (Thread#kill, Thread#raise) immediately after acquiring the lock. [#8403], [#8404]

Standard Library
----------------

* The `fiddle` library is now a default gem and can be upgraded independently of JRuby. [#8385]

Developer Experience
--------------------

* The core jar file of JRuby can be rebuilt more quickly by calling Maven with the `-Dcore` flag. [#8326]
* Support for Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint (OpenJDK Project CRaC), which allows snapshotting a running JRuby process and quickly resuming it later. [#8367]

Java Integration
----------------

* The "lazy" constants feature for classes imported from Java, introduced in JRuby 9.4.8.0, has been reverted due to spurious warnings. We'll revisit it in a future release. [#8349], [#8368], [#8399], [#8400], [#8401]
* Functions were added to allow flushing out thread-local and fiber-local storage for an entire JRuby runtime. [#8369]

Security
--------

* REXML was updated to 3.3.9 to get recent fixes and to address [CVE-2024-49761](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2rxp-v6pw-ch6m), a ReDOS vulnerability. Only users parsing unsanitized XML with REXML are affected. [#8396]
