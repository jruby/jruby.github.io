Ruby Compatibility
------------------

* Fixed a NegativeArraySizeException crash parsing heredocs. [#8355], [#8557]
* Users can now opt into Ruby 3.3 behavior for NoMethodError and NameError that no longer inspects the target object. This inspect frequently led to memory issues. Specify JRuby flag `-XnameError.inspect.object=false` or JVM property `jruby.nameError.inspect.object=false` to disable the inspect call. [#216], [#8384], [#8538]
* Implemented the missing `Process.argv0` method, used by recent Bundler releases. [#8568], [#8570]

Standard Library
----------------

* The jar-dependencies gem, responsible for fetching jar file dependencies of Ruby gems, can now be updated independently of JRuby. [#7262], [#8488], [#8502]
* An upcoming release of jar-dependencies, will fix issues sourcing jar dependencies in container deployments (partially fixed previously by an updated ruby-maven-libs gem). [#7059], [#8366]
* The psych gem is updated to version 5.2.3, including a fix for YAML aliases from SnakeYAML-Engine version 2.9. [#8352], [#8575]
* The reline gem is updated to 0.5.12. [#8481]

Java Integration
----------------

* Only JVM classes imported from the same classloader hierarchy as JRuby will be bound to constants in JRuby's package hierarchy. [#8156]
* Implementing a Java interface no longer leads to constant redefinition warnings. [#8349], [#8503]
* Precompiled Ruby scripts now properly prepare optimized homogeneous case/when statements. Previously they would deserialize incorrectly and garble the branches. [#8421], [#8424]

Performance and Usability
-------------------------

* Additional runtime data structures are eagerly cleared when tearing down a JRuby runtime, aiding GC. [#8343], [#8566]
* The JRuby shell-based launcher script now properly handles JRuby installed in a path with spaces. [#8441], [#8442]
* The `Class#subclasses` method has been optimized to eliminate it as a bottleneck in complex ActiveRecord STI queries. [#8457], [#8462]
* Integer multiplication operations that overflow outside of int64 range have been optimized to eliminate heavy exception raises. [#8516], [#8523]
