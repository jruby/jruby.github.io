title: JRuby 10.0.3.0 Released
---


The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 10.0.3.0.

* Homepage: [https://www.jruby.org/](https://www.jruby.org/)
* Download: [https://www.jruby.org/download](https://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 10.0.3.x targets Ruby 3.4 compatibility.

Thank you to our contributors this release, you help keep JRuby moving forward! @mrnoname1000, @ngr-ilmarh, @Earlopain, @philr, @jotamartos, @kares, @aleksandrs-ledovskis, @trinistr, @katafrakt, @chadlwilson, @khasinski, @evaniainbrooks

Compatibility
-------------

* JRuby now reports `RbConfig::CONFIG['arch']` without a version number, as `universal-java`. This allows using different JDK versions without triggering RubyGems missing extension warnings for installed gems. The host Java version is still available as `RbConfig::CONFIG['arch_version']`. [#9107]

Standard Library
----------------

* The non-gem standard library is upgraded to Ruby 3.4.5 [#8967]
* rexml is updated to 3.4.4 to address CVE-2025-58767. [#9011]
* syslog is moved to a default gem at version 0.4.0. The syslog gem now includes JRuby support. [#9109], [ruby/syslog#1](https://github.com/ruby/syslog/1)
* strscan is updated to 3.1.7. [#9159]

Documentation
-------------

* Ruby ri documentation for core and standard library are now included in the release distribution. [#9049], [#9052]
