# Contributing to JRuby
  
JRuby depends on community contributions to survive. Here's how you can get involved:

**Get the Source** - The JRuby source is stored in our Git repository at JRuby.org and mirrored at GitHub.

- **Browse**: [**GitHub**](http://github.com/jruby/jruby)
- **Checkout**

      git clone git://jruby.org/jruby.git
      git clone http://jruby.org/repo/jruby.git
      git clone git://github.com/jruby/jruby.git
      git clone http://github.com/jruby/jruby.git

*Need [Git help](http://git-scm.com/)? It's ok, we're not Git experts either.*

**Build JRuby** - Once you've checked out the source, you just need to run &quot;mvn&quot;&nbsp;or &quot;mvn package&quot;&nbsp;to build and &quot;mvn -Ptest&quot;&nbsp;to run our Java unit test suite. We depend on <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a> 3.x.

      mvn
      mvn package
      mvn -Ptest

For more detailed information building and other ways to test have a look at <a href="https://github.com/jruby/jruby/blob/master/BUILDING.md">jruby/BUILDING.md</a>.

**Check out the Hacking Guide** - NaHi built an [awesome Prezi fly-through tour of the JRuby codebase][prezi]. Take a look through it for getting bearings with the codebase.

**Report Bugs** - We have 2 bug trackers.
One is a JIRA hosted by the good folks at [Codehaus](http://codehaus.org/).
The other is on github.  The JIRA bug tracker is in read-only mode and you should create all new issues on Github.  JIRA issues only exist for historical context.

- **Github issues**: [**Browse**]({{ site.urls.bugs }})
- **JIRA**: [**Browse**]({{ site.urls.jira }})

**Submit Code Changes** - Code changes are great.  Send them back with a [GitHub pull request][pullrequest] for review.

**Fix the wiki** - We also depend on community contributions and edits to keep our documentation informative and relevant. If you have a useful FAQ or walkthrough or article, please add it to the wiki. And we welcome anyone who wants to help reorganize or edit existing content.

- **Wiki**: [**Browse**]({{ site.urls.wiki }})

**Fix the website** - Our website source code is publicly available, and we graciously accept pull requests!
